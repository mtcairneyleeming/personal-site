Hi! I'm a second-year PhD student at [ISTA](https://ista.ac.at), supervised by [Christoph Lampert](https://cvml.ista.ac.at/). I'm working on private machine learning, on topics like differential privacy, auditing and data-dependent privacy. I am interested in finding new tradeoffs between the strictness of worst-case differential privacy and our ability to train larger and more realistic models.  

 My [CV](/assets/pdf/cv14.11.2022.pdf) is in desperate need of updating (soon!). My personal projects are linked [here](/projects).
