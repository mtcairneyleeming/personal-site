Hey! I'm a first-year PhD student at [ISTA](https://ista.ac.at), and am currently doing "internships" ([rotations](https://phd.pages.ist.ac.at/phd-program-overview/) in ISTA jargon) to explore a range of topics within machine learning, and to help find a supervisor to affiliate with long-term. My CV (written for PhD applications, not a standard academic format) can be found [here](/cv), and I also have a few [projects](/projects), though not written up in much depth, yet.
