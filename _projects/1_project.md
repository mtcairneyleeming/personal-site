A website to genereate 3D printable models of fractals, using Lindenmayer-systems. Written to accompany two videos I made during my internship with Dr. Tom Crawford on his youtube channel [Tom Rocks Maths](https://tomrocksmaths.com/), aimed at students and the general public interested in maths.  The two videos are also embedded below
