An older project, which I developed to help study for my Latin A-Level exams (the final qualifications in the UK school system - Latin was one of four subjects I studied in the last two years of school). It allows you to highlight and add comments to texts, so that I could neatly organise (without handwriting-related issues) all the notes I took about the texts we studied. Also includes print support, to make revision easier! I used texts from the wonderful [Perseus Digital Library](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/) (also their [newer site](https://scaife.perseus.org/)), and developed a (somewhat manual) import method, that could cope with all the fun of XML and the differences between prose and verse texts/etc.
