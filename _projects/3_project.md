The code underpinning my Master's Project at Oxford with [Seth Flaxman](https://sethrf.com/) and [Elizaveta Semenova](https://www.elizaveta-semenova.com/), extending and building on some of their prior work, a GP approximation called [PriorVAE](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2022.0094) for much, much faster MCMC. My project was to explore how we might train a VAE to better approximate the GP by changing the loss function - my primary explorations were with the maximum mean discrepancy. The project was also a good opportunity to reimplement PriorVAE and get more familiar with (the pains of) working with the computing cluster, which ran SLURM.
